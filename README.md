### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

### About me

I am a Political Scientist with interests in peace and conflict, sexual violence in armed conflict, international law, and interstate cooperation. As a researcher, I believe in **the power of mixed-methods approaches**, which can highlight both broader trends vis-a-vis data analyses while also illuminating details on the ground through case studies, interviews, focus groups, and other qualitative approaches.

To this end, I am currently developing my quantitative skill set via an M.A. in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at Columbia University.

I am currently seeking opportunities to contribute these skills after I graduate in May 2022. Please contact if you know of a good fit!
